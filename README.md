Milestone one project repository for the University of Michigan Masters of Applied Data Science Program. This is a living .readme that will be updated throughout the project.

## Branches

### 1. `main` (or `master`)

The `main` branch represents the stable version of the project.

### 2. `develop`

The `develop` branch is used for ongoing development work. Features in progress and bug fixes that are not yet ready for production are merged into this branch. Collaborators should base their work on this branch for active development.

### 3. `data`

The `data` branch is designated for tasks related to data management, cleaning, and preprocessing. If you are working on data-related aspects of the project, create a new branch from `develop` with a meaningful name (e.g., `data-cleaning`). Merge it back into `develop` once the data-related tasks are complete.

### 4. `doc`

The `doc` branch is reserved for documentation updates. This includes updates to the README file, inline code comments, and any other documentation related to the project. Collaborators are encouraged to create a branch from `develop` for documentation tasks (e.g., `doc-update`) and merge it back after the documentation is complete.
